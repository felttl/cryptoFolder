# cryptoFolder
allow anyone to use both RSA and AES to encrypt an entire folder with all it's files inside and their names

project start soon

# java application tu run everywhere

## requirements

- Java JDK 23 (or open source variant (OpenJDK 23)) installed

## simple as possible

to resume we have this :

### to encrypt

1 folder location on the disk as input
1 folder (folder is encrypted but not his name) as output

### to decrypt

1 folder encrypted as input
1 folder decrypted as output

that's all

maybe for next version we can add something to compilers
(if there is folder containing code to be run by interpreters or compilers
as encrypted repertory to be directly de-crypted and run into it)
